                <p class="mb-5 text-muted">
                    By accessing this website, you acknowledge that Robert Hotel is a figment of our collective
                    imagination.
                    Booking a room does not guarantee a room, a bed, or even a building.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mb-4">2. Payment Policy</h3>
                <p class="mb-5 text-muted">
                    We accept all forms of non-existent currency. Monopoly money, chocolate coins, and "exposure" are
                    all valid payment methods
                    for your imaginary stay. No refunds will be issued because you haven't actually paid anything.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mb-4">3. Cancellation Policy</h3>
                <p class="mb-5 text-muted">
                    You may cancel your imaginary booking at any time. Since you never essentially arrived, you never
                    left.
                    It is a philosophical conundrum we prefer not to dwell on.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mb-4">4. Liability</h3>
                <p class="mb-5 text-muted">
                    Robert Hotel is not responsible for any disappointment caused by realizing you are still sitting at
                    your computer
                    instead of on a beach in paradise.
